\csection{Introduction}\label{sec_cont_func_intro}

We have likely had previous experiences with continuous functions. Continuity is an important consideration in optimization problems because a continuous function attains a maximum value and a minimum value on any closed and bounded interval. Continuous functions also satisfy the Intermediate Value Theorem, that a continuous function $f$ takes on all values between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ on an interval $[a,b]$. An important consequence of the Intermediate Value Theorem is that if $f$ is a continuous function on an interval and $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ have opposite signs, then $f$ must have a root in the interval $[a,b]$. In this section we will begin to explore continuity of functions between metric spaces. Our ultimate goal in future sections is to understand continuous functions well enough that we can define continuity just in terms of open sets. 

In calculus we discuss the idea of continuity. A function $f:\R \to \R$ (using the standard Euclidean metric) is continuous at a point $a$ if 
\[\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a).\]
This involved providing some explanation about what it means for a function $f$ to have a limit at a point. Intuitively, the idea is that a function $f$ has a limit $L$ at $x=a$ if we can make all of the value of $f(x)$ as close to $L$ as we want by choosing $x$ as close to (but not equal to) $a$ as we need. To extend this informal notion of limit to continuity at a point we would say that a function $f$ is continuous at a point $a$ if if we can make all of the value of $f(x)$ as close to $f(a)$ as we want by choosing $x$ as close to $a$ as we need (now $x$ can equal $a$). 

In order to define continuity in a more general context (in topological spaces) we will need to have a rigorous definition of continuity to work with. We will begin by discussing continuous functions from $\R$ to $\R$, and build from that to continuous functions in metric spaces. These ideas will allow us to ultimately define continuous functions in topological spaces. 

We begin by working with continuous functions from $\R$ to $\R$. Our goal is to make more rigorous our informal definition of continuity at a point. To do so will require us to formally defining what we mean by 
\begin{itemize}
\item making the values of $f(x)$ ``as close to $f(a)$ as we want", and
\item choosing $x$ ``as close to $a$ as we need".
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[ht]

\caption{Demonstrating the definition of continuity at a point.}
\label{F:Continuity}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
Let's deal with the first statement, making the values of $f(x)$ ``as close to $f(a)$ as we want". What this means is that if we set any tolerance, say $0.0001$, then we can make the values of $f(x)$ within $0.0001$ of $f(a)$. Since the absolute value $| f(x)-f(a) |$ measures how close $f(x)$ is to $f(a)$, we can rewrite the statement that the values of $f(x)$ are within $0.0001$ of $f(a)$ as $| f(x) - f(a) | < 0.0001$. Of course, $0.0001$ may not be as close as we want to $f(a)$, so we need a way to indicate that we can make the values of $f(x)$ arbitrarily close to $f(a)$ -- within any tolerance at all. We do this by making the tolerance a parameter, $\epsilon$. Then our job is to make the values of $f(x)$ within $\epsilon$ of $f(a)$ regardless of the size of $\epsilon$. We write this as 
\[| f(x) - f(a) | < \epsilon.\]
We can picture this as shown at left in Figure \ref{F:Continuity}. Here we want to make the values of $f(x)$ lie within an $\epsilon$ band of $f(a)$ above and below $f(a)$. That is, we want to be able to make the values of $f(x)$ lie between $f(a)-\epsilon$ and $f(a)+\epsilon$. 

Now we have to address the question of how we ``make" the values of $f(x)$ to be within $\epsilon$ of $f(a)$. Since the values $f(x)$ are the dependent values, dependent on $x$, we ``make" the values of $f(x)$ have the property we want by choosing the inputs $x$ appropriately.  In order for $f$ to be continuous at $x=a$, we must be able to find $x$ values close enough to $a$ to force $| f(x) - f(a) | < \epsilon$. Pictorially, we can see how this might happen in the image at right in Figure \ref{F:Continuity}. We need to be able to find an interval around $x=a$ so that the graph of $f(x)$ lies in the $\epsilon$ band around $f(a)$ for values of $x$ in that interval. In other words, we need to be able to find some positive number $\delta$ so that if $x$ is in the interval $(a-\delta, a+\delta)$, then the graph of $f(x)$ lies in the $\epsilon$ band around $y=f(a)$. More formally, if we are given any positive tolerance $\epsilon$, we must be able to find a positive number $\delta$ so that if $| x-a | < \delta$ (that is, $x$ is in the interval $(a-\delta, a+\delta)$), then $| f(x) - f(a) | < \epsilon$ (or $f(x)$ lies in the $\epsilon$ band around $y=f(a)$).   

This gives us a rigorous definition of what it means for a function $f: \R \to \R$ to be continuous at a point.

\begin{definition} \label{def:epsilon_delta_continuity} A function $f : \R \to \R$ is \textbf{continuous at a point} $a$ if, given any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ so that $| x - a | < \delta$ implies $| f(x) - f(a)| < \epsilon$.
\end{definition}

Note that the value of $\delta$ can depend on the value of $a$ and on $\epsilon$, but not on values of $x$.

\[| f(x) - f(1) | = | f\left(1-\frac{\delta}{2}\right) - f(1) | = | -1 - 1 | = 2.\]
So $| f(x) - f(1) | > \epsilon$. This shows that $f$ is not continuous at $x=1$.

\csection{Continuous Functions Between Metric Spaces}\label{sec_cont_func_btwn}
In our preview activity we saw how to formally define what it means for a function $f : \R \to \R$ to be continuous at a point. 


Note that Definition \ref{def:epsilon_delta_continuity} depends only on being able to measure how close points are to each other. Since that is precisely what a metric does, we can extend this notion of continuity to define continuity for functions between metric spaces. Continuity is an important idea in topology, and we will work with this idea extensively throughout the semester.
 
If we let $d_E : \R \times \R \to \R$ be defined by $d_R(x,y) = | x - y |$, then we have seen that $d_E$ is a metric on $\R$ (note that $d_E$ is the Euclidean metric on $\R$). Using this metric we can reformulate what it means for a function $f : \R \to \R$ to be continuous at a point.

\begin{definition}[Alternate Definition] A function $f : \R \to \R$ is \textbf{continuous at a point} $a$ if, given any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ so that $d_E(x,a) < \delta$ implies $d_E(f(x), f(a)) < \epsilon$.
\end{definition}

This alternate definition depends on the metric $d_E$. We could easily replace the metric $d$ with any other metric we choose. This allows us to define continuity at a point for functions between metric spaces.

\begin{definition} Let $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y)$ be metric spaces. A function $f:X \to Y$ is \textbf{continuous}\index{continuity at a point in a metric space} at $a \in X$ if, given any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ so that $d_X(x,a)< \delta$ implies $d_Y(f(x), f(a)) < \epsilon$.  
\end{definition}

Once we have defined continuity at a point, we can define continuous functions.

\begin{definition} Let $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y)$ be metric spaces. A function $f:X \to Y$ is \textbf{continuous}\index{continuous function} if $f$ is continuous at every point in $X$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{example} In general, to prove that a function $f:X \to Y$ is continuous, where $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y)$ are metric spaces, we begin by choosing an arbitrary element $a$ in $X$. Then we let $\epsilon$ be a number greater than $0$ and show that there is a $\delta > 0$ so that $d_Y(f(x),f(a)) < \epsilon$ whenever $d_X(x,a) < \delta$. The $\delta$ we need cannot depend on $x$ (since $x$ isn't known), but can depend on the value of $a$ that we choose, and will likely depend on $\epsilon$ as well. That is, there is a function $C$ of only the independent variables $a$ and $\epsilon$ that produces the $\delta$, or $\delta = C(a,\epsilon)$. As an example, let $X = \R$ and let $d_X$ be defined as 
\[d_X(x,y) = \min\{|x-y|,1\}.\]
The proof that $d_X$ is a metric is left for Exercise \ref{ex:min_1_metric}. Consider $f : X \to Y$ defined by $f(x) = x^2$, where $(Y,d_Y) = (\R, d_E)$. To show that $f$ is continuous, we let $a \in \R$ and let $\epsilon > 0$. 

\begin{quote} \textbf{Scratch work.} What happens next is not part of the proof, but shows how we go about finding a $\delta$ we need. We are looking for $\delta > 0$ such that $d_X(x,a) < \delta$ implies that $d_E(f(x),f(a)) < \epsilon$. That is, we want to make 
\[d_E(f(x),f(a)) = \sqrt{(f(x)-f(a))^2} = |f(x)-f(a)| = |x^2-a^2| < \epsilon\]
whenever
\[d_X(x,a) = \min\{|x-a|, 1\} < \delta.\]
Now $|x^2-a^2| = |(x-a)(x+a)| = |x-a| \ |x+a|$. If $d_X(x,a) < \delta$, then $\min\{|x-a|, 1\} < \delta$. If we choose $\delta < 1$, then $d_X(x,a) < \delta < 1$ implies that $|x-a| < 1$ and so $d_X(x,a) = |x-a|$. Now
\[|x+a| = |(x-a) + 2a| \leq |x-a| + 2|a| < 1+2|a|.\]
It follows that 
\[|x-a| \ |x+a| < \delta(1+2|a|).\]
To make this product less that $\epsilon$, we can choose $\delta$ such that $\delta(1+2|a|) < \epsilon$ or $\delta < \frac{\epsilon}{1+2|a|}$. That is, there is a function $C$ of $\epsilon$ that gives us the $\delta$ we want, namely $\delta = C(a,\epsilon) = \left\{1, \frac{\epsilon}{1+2|a|}\right\}$. 

Now we ignore this paragraph and present the proof, which is essentially reversing the steps we just made. If the steps can't be reversed, then we have to rethink our argument. The next step in the proof might seem like magic to the uninitiated reader, but we have seen behind the curtain so it isn't a mystery to us.
\end{quote}

\noindent Let $\delta$ be a positive number less than $\min\left\{1, \frac{\epsilon}{1+2|a|}\right\}$. Then 
\[d_X(x,a) = \min\{|x-a|,1\} < \delta\]
implies that $d_X(x,a) < \delta < 1$ and so $d_X(x,a) = |x-a| < \delta < 1$. Then
\[|x+a| = |(x-a) + 2a| \leq |x-a| + 2|a| < 1+2|a|.\]
It follows that
\begin{align*}
d_E(f(x),f(a)) &= \sqrt{(f(x)-f(a))^2} \\
	&= |f(x)-f(a)| \\
	&= |x^2-a^2| \\
	&= |(x-a)(x+a)| \\
	&= |x-a| \ |x+a| \\
	&< \delta (1+2|a|) \\
	&<  \left(\frac{\epsilon}{1+2|a|}\right) (1+2|a|) \\
	&= \epsilon.
\end{align*}
We conclude that $f$ is continuous at every point in $X$ and so $f$ is a continuous function.
\end{example}

Not all functions are continuous as we see in the next example. 

\begin{example} \label{exp:not_continuous} Let $X = Y = \R$ and define $f : X \to Y$  by $f(x) = x$. Let $d_X$ be the Euclidean metric and $d_Y$ the discrete metric. (Recall that $d_Y(x,y) = 1$ whenever $x \neq y$.) Let $a \in X$ and let $0 < \epsilon < 1$. 
 
Let $\delta > 0$, and let $x = a+\frac{\delta}{2}$. Then $x \neq a$ and $d_X(x,a) < \delta$. However, 
\[d_Y(f(x),f(a)) = d_Y(x,a) = 1.\]
So if $0 < \epsilon < 1$, there is no $\delta > 0$ such that $d_X(x,a) < \delta$ implies that $d_Y(f(x),f(a)) < \epsilon$. We conclude that $f$ is continuous at no point in $X$.  
\end{example}

Certain functions are always continuous, as the next activity shows.

More complicated examples are in the next activity.

\begin{activity} Let $X = (\R^2, d_T)$ and $Y = (\R^2, d_M)$, where 
\[d_T((x_1, x_2), (y_1,y_2)) = | x_1-y_1 | + | x_2-y_2 |\]
is the taxicab metric and 
\[d_M((x_1, x_2), (y_1,y_2)) = \max\{| x_1-y_1 |,  | x_2-y_2 |\}\]
is the max metric. Define $f : \R^2 \to \R^2$ by $f((a,b)) = (a+b, b)$.

	\ba
	\item  Let $a=(a_1,a_2) \in \R^2$ and let $\epsilon > 0$. Choose any $0 < \delta < \epsilon$. Let $x = (x_1,x_2)$ in $\R^2$ and suppose $d_T(x,a) < \delta$. Then
\[d_T(x,a) = | x_1-a_1\ | + | x_2-a_2 | < \delta = \epsilon.\]
It follows that
\begin{align*}
d_M(f(x), f(a)) &= d_M((x_1+x_2, x_1), (a_1+a_2, a_2)) \\
	&= \max\{ | (x_1+x_2)-(a_1+a_2) |, | x_2-a_2 | \} \\
	&= \max\{ | (x_1-a_1)+(x_2-a_2) |, | x_2-a_2 | \} \\

	&= |x_1-a_1|+|x_2-a_2| < \epsilon.
	\end{align*}
Thus, the function $f$ is continuous at every point in $\R^2$ and is therefore a continuous function from $X$ to $Y$. 

	\item  Let $a=(a_1,a_2) \in \R^2$ and let $\epsilon > 0$. Choose any $0 < \delta < \frac{\epsilon}{3}$. Let $x = (x_1,x_2)$ in $\R^2$ and suppose $d_M(x,a) < \delta$. Then
\[d_M(x,a) = \max\{| x_1-a_1\ |, | x_2-a_2 |\} < \delta < \frac{\epsilon}{3}.\]
So $| x_1-a_1 | < \frac{\epsilon}{3}$ and $| x_2-a_2 | < \frac{\epsilon}{3}$. Then
\begin{align*}
d_T(f(x), f(a)) &= d_T((x_1+x_2, x_1), (a_1+a_2, a_2)) \\
	&= | (x_1+x_2)-(a_1+a_2) | + | x_2-a_2 |  \\
	&= | (x_1-a_1)+(x_2-a_2) | + | x_2-a_2 | \} \\
	&\leq \left(| x_1-a_1 | + | x_2-a_2 |\right) + | x_2-a_2 | \\
	&\leq \frac{\epsilon}{3}+\frac{\epsilon}{3} + \frac{\epsilon}{3}  \\
	&= \epsilon.
\end{align*}
Thus, the function $f$ is continuous at every point in $\R^2$ and is therefore a continuous function from $Y$ to $X$.

Continuity is an important concept in topology. We have seen how to define continuity in metric spaces, and we will soon expand on this idea to define continuity without reference to metrics at all. This will allow us to later define continuous functions between arbitrary topological spaces. 


\csection{Summary}\label{sec_cont_func_summ}
Important ideas that we discussed in this section include the following.
\begin{itemize}
\item Let $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y)$ be metric spaces. A function $f:X \to Y$ is continuous at $a \in X$ if, given any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ so that $d_X(x,a)< \delta$ implies $d_Y(f(x), f(a)) < \epsilon$.  

\item Let $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y)$ be metric spaces. A function $f:X \to Y$ is continuous if $f$ is continuous at every point in $X$.
\end{itemize}

\item Let $f: \R \to \R$ be defined by $f(x) = |x|$, with the Euclidean metric on both the domain and the codomain. Is $f$ continuous at $x=0$? Prove your answer.

\begin{comment}

\ExerciseSolution The answer is yes. Let $\epsilon$ be greater than $0$. Let $\delta = \epsilon$. Then $|x - 0| < \delta$ means that $|x| < \delta$. Then $|f(x)-f(0)| = |x| < \delta = \epsilon$. So $f$ is continuous at $0$. 

\end{comment}

\item Let $f: \R \to \R$ be defined by $f(x) = \begin{cases} \frac{x}{|x|} &\text{ if } x \neq 0 \\ 1 &\text{ if } x=0. \end{cases}$ Is $f$ continuous at $x=0$? Prove your answer.

\begin{comment}

\ExerciseSolution The answer is no. Let $\epsilon$ be greater than $0$ and less than $1$, and let $\delta$ be greater than $0$. If $x \in (0, \delta)$, then $f(x) = 1$. Then $|x - 0| < \delta$ implies that 
\[|f(x)-f(0)| = |1-0|  = 1 > \epsilon.\]

\item Let $a = (a_1, a_2)$ be in $X$.  We will demonstrate that $f$ is continuous at $a$.  Let $\epsilon$ be greater than $0$. Let $\delta = \frac{\epsilon}{2}$. Suppose $x = (x_1,x_2) \in X$ such that $d_E(x,a) < \delta$. Then
\[d_E(x,a) = \sqrt{(x_1-a_1)^2 + (x_2-a_2)^2} < \delta.\]
Now
\[|x_1-a_1| = \sqrt{(x_1-a_1)^2} \leq \sqrt{(x_1-a_1)^2 + (x_2-a_2)^2} < \delta = \frac{\epsilon}{2}\]
and
\[|x_2-a_2| = \sqrt{(x_2-a_2)^2} \leq \sqrt{(x_1-a_1)^2 + (x_2-a_2)^2} < \delta = \frac{\epsilon}{2}.\]
This implies that 
\begin{align*}
d_E(f(x),f(a)) &= |(x_1+x_2)-(a_1+a_2)| \\
	&= |(x_1-a_1)+(x_2-a_2)| \\
	&\leq |x_1-a_1| + |x_2-a_2| \\
	&< \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} \\
	&= \epsilon.
\end{align*}
Thus, $f$ is continuous at every point in $X$ and so $f$ is a continuous function.

\item Let $a = (a_1, a_2)$ be in $X$.  We will demonstrate that $f$ is continuous at $a$.  Let $\epsilon$ be greater than $0$. Let $\delta = \frac{\epsilon}{2}$. Suppose $x = (x_1,x_2) \in X$ such that $d_M(x,a) < \delta$. Then
\[d_M(x,a) = \max\{|x_1-a_1|, |x_2-a_2|\}  < \delta = \epsilon.\]
\begin{align*}
d_E(f(x),f(a)) &= |(x_1+x_2)-(a_1+a_2)| \\
	&= |(x_1-a_1)+(x_2-a_2)| \\
	&\leq |x_1-a_1| + |x_2-a_2| \\
	&< \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} \\

Thus, $f$ is continuous at every point in $X$ and so $f$ is a continuous function.

\item Let $X$ be any set and define $d : X \times X \to \R$ by 
\[d(x,y) = \begin{cases} 0 &\text{ if } x=y \\ 1 &\text{ if } x \neq y. \end{cases}\]
Exercise \ref{ex:MS_discrete} on page \pageref{ex:MS_discrete} asks us to show that $d$ is a metric (the discrete metric) on $\R$. 

Let $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y)$ be metric spaces with $d_X$ the discrete metric. Determine all of the continuous functions $f$ from $X$ to $Y$. 

\begin{comment}

\ExerciseSolution We will prove that any function $f: X \to Y$ is continuous. Let $f: X \to Y$ be a function and let $a \in X$. Let $\epsilon$ be a positive real number and let $\delta = 1$. For any $x \in X$ with $d_X(x,a) < \delta$, it must be the case that $x = a$. It follows that $d_Y(f(x),f(a)) = d_Y(f(a),f(a)) = 0 < \epsilon$. So $f$ is continuous at every point in $X$ and $f$ is a continuous function.

\item Let $\epsilon > 0$ be given and let $a \in \R$. Since $f$ is continuous at $a$ there is a $\delta > 0$ such that $d_E(f(x),f(a)) < \frac{\epsilon}{|k|}$ whenever $d_E(x,a) < \delta$. Then
\[d_E((kf)(x), (kf)(a)) = d_E(kf(x), kf(a)) = |kf(x)-kf(a)| = |k||f(x)-f(a)| < |k|\ \frac{\epsilon}{k} = \epsilon\]
whenever $d_E(x,a) < \delta$. We conclude that $kf$ is continuous at every $a \in \R$ and so $kf$ is a continuous function. 


\item Let $\epsilon$ be greater than $0$ and let $a \in \R$. Since $f$ is continuous at $a$, there exists $\delta_f > 0$ such that $d_E(f(x),f(a)) < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$ whenever $d_E(x,a) < \delta_f$. Similarly, since $g$ is continuous at $a$, there exists $\delta_g > 0$ such that $d_E(g(x),g(a)) < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$ whenever $d_E(x, a) < \delta_g$. Let $\delta = \min\left\{\delta_f, \delta_g\right\}$. Now suppose that $d_E(x,a) < \delta$. Then 
\begin{align*}
d_E((f+g)(x), (f+g)(a)) &= d_E(f(x)+g(x), f(a) + g(a)) \\
	&= |f(x)-f(a) + g(x)-g(a)| \\
	&\leq |f(x)-f(a)| + |g(x)-g(a)| \\
	&= d_E(f(x),f(a)) + d_E(g(x), g(a)) \\
	< \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} \\
	&= \epsilon.

Thus, $f+g$ is a continuous function.

\item Let $f$ and $g$ be continuous functions from $(\R, d_E)$ to $(\R,d_E)$. In this exercise we will prove that $fg$ is a continuous function from $\R$ to $\R$.  Let $a$ be in $\R$, and follow the steps below to show that $fg$ is continuous at $x=a$. Let $\epsilon$ be a positive number.

	\ba
	
	\item We will first want to express $f(x)g(x) - f(a)g(a)$ in a more useful way. Use the fact that $f(x) = f(a) + (f(x)-f(a))$ and $g(x)  = g(a) + (g(x)-g(a))$ to show that 
	\begin{equation*}
	f(x)g(x)-f(a)g(a) = f(a)(g(x)-g(a)) + g(a)(f(x)-f(a)) + (f(x)-f(a))(g(x)-g(a)).
	\end{equation*}
	
	\item Explain why there exist positive numbers $\delta_1$, $\delta_2$, $\delta_3$, and $\delta_4$ such that 
\begin{align*}
|f(x)-f(a)| < \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{3}} &\text{ when } |x-a| < \delta_1 \\
|g(x)-g(a)| <  \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{3}}  &\text{ when } |x-a| < \delta_2 \\
|f(x)-f(a)| < \frac{\epsilon}{3(1+|g(a)|)}  &\text{ when } |x-a| < \delta_3 \\
|g(x)-g(a)| < \frac{\epsilon}{3(1+|f(a)|)}  &\text{ when } |x-a| < \delta_4.

\item We write $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ as $f(x) = f(a) + (f(x)-f(a))$ and $g(x)  = g(a) + (g(x)-g(a))$. Then
\begin{align*}
f(x)g(x)-f(a)g(a) &= \big(f(a) + (f(x)-f(a))\big) \big(g(a) + (g(x)-g(a)) \big) - f(a) g(a) \\
	&= f(a)(g(x)-g(a)) + g(a)(f(x)-f(a)) + (f(x)-f(a))(g(x)-g(a)).
\end{align*}

\item Since $\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{3}}$ is a positive number and since $f$ is continuous at $x=a$, there exists a positive number $\delta_1$ such that 
\[|f(x)-f(a)| < \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{3}} \text{ when } |x-a| < \delta_1.\]
A similar argument shows that 
\begin{align*}
|g(x)-g(a)| <  \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{3}}  &\text{ when } |x-a| < \delta_2 \\
|f(x)-f(a)| < \frac{\epsilon}{3(1+|g(a)|)}  &\text{ when } |x-a| < \delta_3 \\
|g(x)-g(a)| < \frac{\epsilon}{3(1+|f(a)|)}  &\text{ when } |x-a| < \delta_4
\end{align*}
for some positive real numbers $\delta_2$, $\delta_3$, and $\delta_4$. 

\item Now let $\delta$ be the minimum of $\delta_1$, $\delta_2$, $\delta_3$, and $\delta_4$. It follows that 
\begin{align*}
|f(x)g(x)-f(a)g(a)| &= \left|\big(f(a) + (f(x)-f(a))\big) \big(g(a) + (g(x)-g(a)) \big) - f(a) g(a) \right| \\
	&= |f(a)(g(x)-g(a)) + g(a)(f(x)-f(a)) + (f(x)-f(a))(g(x)-g(a))| \\ 
	&\leq |f(a)| \ |g(x)-g(a)| + |g(a)| \ |f(x)-f(a)| + |f(x)-f(a)| \ |g(x)-g(a)| \\
	&< (1+|f(a)|) \left(\frac{\epsilon}{3(1+|f(a)|)}  \right) + (1+|g(a)|) \left( \frac{\epsilon}{3(1+|g(a)|)}  \right) + \left(\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{3}}\right) \left(\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{3}}\right) \\
	&= \frac{\epsilon}{3} + \frac{\epsilon}{3}  + \frac{\epsilon}{3}  \\
	&= \epsilon.

So $fg$ is a continuous function.

\item The answer is no. Let $f: \R \to \R$ with the Euclidean metric on both the domain and codomain be defined by $f(x) = \begin{cases} 1 &\text{ if } x \geq 0 \\ 0 &\text{ if } x < 0. \end{cases}$. Let $g(x) = -f(x)$ for all $x \in \R$. Then $f+g$ is the constant function $0$ and so $f+g$ is a continuous function. However, the function $f$ is not continuous at $x=0$. To see why, let $\epsilon = \frac{1}{2}$. For any $\delta > 0$, if $x \in (0, \delta)$, then $f(x) = 1$. So $|x - 0| < \delta$ does not imply that $|f(x)-f(0)| < \epsilon$.   

\item Again, the answer is no. Let $f(x)$ be as in part (a) and let $g(x) = \begin{cases} 0 &\text{ if } x \geq 0 \\ 0 &\text{ if } x < 1. \end{cases}$. Then $fg$ is the constant function $0$ but $f$ is not continuous at $x=0$.

\ExerciseSolution

\item First we find a candidate for our value for $\delta$, then we show that our value of $\delta$ works. To find a value of $\delta$, we work backwards. Note that $|x - 1| < \frac{1}{4}$ implies that $-\frac{1}{4} < x-1 < \frac{1}{4}$ or that $\frac{7}{4} < x+1 < \frac{9}{4}$. Thus, $\frac{7}{4} < |x+1| < \frac{9}{4}$ and $\frac{4}{9} < \frac{1}{|x+1|} < \frac{4}{7}$. Assume $|f(x)-f(a)| < \frac{1}{4}$. Then
\begin{align*}
| 2x^2+1 - (2(1)^2+1)| &< \frac{1}{4} \\
|2x^2-2| &< \frac{1}{4} \\
|x^2-1| &< \frac{1}{8} \\
|x-1||x+1| &< \frac{1}{8} \\
|x-1| &< \frac{1}{8}\left(\frac{1}{|x+1|}\right). 
\end{align*}
So if we choose $\delta = \frac{1}{8}\left(\frac{4}{9}\right)$, then 
\[|x-1| < \delta < \frac{1}{8}\left(\frac{4}{9}\right) < \frac{1}{8}\left(\frac{1}{|x+1|}\right).\] 

Now we reverse the process to show that this value of $\delta$ works. Let $\delta = \frac{1}{18} = \frac{1}{8}\left(\frac{4}{9}\right)$. Then $|x -1 | < \delta$ implies 
\begin{align*}
|x-1| &< \frac{1}{8}\left(\frac{4}{9}\right) \\
|x-1| &< \frac{1}{8}\left(\frac{1}{|x+1|}\right) \\
|x-1||x+1| &< \frac{1}{8} \\
|x^2-1| &< \frac{1}{8} \\
|2x^2-2| &< \frac{1}{4} \\
| 2x^2+1 - (2(1)^2+1)| &< \frac{1}{4} \\
|f(x) - f(1)| &< \epsilon.
\end{align*}

\item In (a) we showed that if $\epsilon$ is greater than or equal to $\frac{1}{4}$, we can find a $\delta$ such that $|x-1| < \delta$ implies $|f(x)-f(a)| < \epsilon$. So let $\epsilon > 0$ and $\$\epsilon < \frac{1}{4}$. Then $|x - 1| < \epsilon$ implies that $-\epsilon < x-1 < \epsilon$ or that $2-\epsilon < x+1 < 2+\epsilon$. Thus, $\frac{1}{2+\epsilon} < |x+1| < \frac{1}{2-\epsilon}$. To find the $\delta$ we want, assume $|f(x)-f(a)| < \epsilon$. Then
\begin{align*}
| 2x^2+1 - (2(1)^2+1)| &< \epsilon \\
|2x^2-2| &< \epsilon \\
|x^2-1| &< \frac{\epsilon}{2} \\
|x-1||x+1| &< \frac{\epsilon}{2} \\
|x-1| &< \frac{\epsilon}{2}\left(\frac{1}{|x+1|}\right).
\end{align*}
To make $|x-1| < \frac{\epsilon}{2}\left(\frac{1}{|x+1|}\right)$ we can use $\delta = \frac{\epsilon}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2+\epsilon}\right)$.

Let $\delta = \frac{\epsilon}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2+\epsilon}\right)$. Then $|x -1 | < \delta$ implies 
\begin{align*}
|x-1| &< \frac{\epsilon}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2+\epsilon}\right)\\
|x-1| &< \frac{\epsilon}{2}\left(\frac{1}{|x+1|}\right) \\
|x-1||x+1| &< \frac{\epsilon}{2}  \\
|x^2-1| &< \frac{\epsilon}{2} \\
|2x^2-2| &< \epsilon \\
| 2x^2+1 - (2(1)^2+1)| &< \epsilon  \\
|f(x) - f(1)| &< \epsilon.
\end{align*}
Therefore, $f$ is continuous at $x=1$.

\item \label{ex:min_1_metric} Define $d: \R \times \R \to \R$ as 
\[d(x,y) = \min\{|x-y|,1\}.\]
Prove that $d$ is a metric.

\begin{comment}

\ExerciseSolution Let $x, y, z \in \R$. By definition, $d(x,y) \geq 0$. Since $|x - x| = 0$, we see that $d(x,x) = 0$. Also, if $d(x,y) = 0$, then $0 = d(x,y) = |x-y|$ and $x=y$. 

If $d(x,y) = 1$, then $|x-y| = |y-x| \geq 1$ and so $d(y,x) = d(x,y) = 1$. If $d(x,y) < 1$, then $|x-y| = |y-x| < 1$ and so $d(y,x) = |y-x| = d(x,y)$. 

Finally, we verify the triangle inequality using cases.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Suppose one of $d(x,y)$ is $1$. Without loss of generality, assume $d(x,y) = 1$. Now $d(x,z) \leq 1$, so 
\[d(x,z) \leq 1 \leq 1 + d(y,z) = d(x,y) + d(y,z).\]

\item Suppose that $d(x,y) = |x-y| < 1$ and $d(y,z) = |y-z| < 1$. Since $d(x,z) \leq |x-z|$ we have 
\[d(x,z) \leq |x-z| \leq |x-y|+|y-z| = d(x,y) + d(y,z).\]	
	
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{itemize}

We conclude that $d$ is a metric on $\R$.

By Exercise \ref{ex:GLB_rational} on page \pageref{ex:GLB_rational} we can always find a rational number between any two real numbers. So there is a rational number $r$ in the interval $(y - \delta, y + \delta)$. So even though $|r - y| < \delta$, we have $|f(r)-f(y)| = |f(y)| > \epsilon$.

\ExerciseSolution First we demonstrate that $g$ is continuous at $0$. Let $\epsilon$ be a positive real number and let $\delta = \epsilon$. Suppose $x \in \R$ with $|x - 0| = |x| < \delta$. If $x$ is irrational then 
\[|g(x)-g(0)| = |g(x)| = 0 < \epsilon\]
and if $x$ is rational then 
\[|g(x)-g(0)| = |g(x)| = |x| < \delta = \epsilon.\]
Therefore, $g$ is continuous at $0$. 

Now suppose $a \neq 0$. Let $\epsilon < |a|$ and $\delta$ be positive. We consider cases.

\item Here we have $|t^2-(3-2t)| = |t^2+2t-3|$. Now $t^2+2t-3 = (t+3)(t-1)$, and so $t^2+2t-3 \leq 0$ on $[-3,1]$ and $t^2+2t-3 \geq 0$ on $[1,3]$. Therefore, 
\begin{align*}
d^*(f,g) &= \int_{-3}^3 |t^2+2t-3| \, dt \\
	&=  \int_{-3}^1 -(t^2+2t-3) \, dt + \int_1^3 t^2+2t-3 \, dt \\

\[I(f) = \int_0^2 2t \, dt = t^2\bigm|_0^2 = 4.\]

\item Let $(X, d^*)$ and $I$ be defined as in the problem statement. Recall that a function $F : (Y, d_Y) \to (Z, d_Z)$ is continuous at the point $b \in Y$ if, given any $\epsilon > 0$ there exists $\delta > 0$ so that $d_Y(y,b) < \delta$ implies $d_Z(F(y), F(b)) < \epsilon$. Translating that continuity statement to our situation, to prove that $I$ is continuous at $f \in X$, we need to demonstrate that for any $\epsilon > 0$ there exists $\delta > 0$ so that $d^*(g,f) < \delta$ implies $d(I(g), I(f)) < \epsilon$. 

Let $f \in X$, and let $\epsilon > 0$. Let $\delta = \epsilon$. Now let $g \in X$ such that $d^*(g,f) < \delta$. That means 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Ex1_p39_1}
d^*(g,f) = \int_a^b \la g(t) - f(t) \ra \, dt < \delta = \epsilon.
\end{equation}
We need to prove that $d(I(g), I(f)) < \epsilon$. By definition of $d$ and $I$ we have 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Ex1_p39_2}
d(I(g), I(f)) = \la \int_a^b g(t) \, dt - \int_a^b f(t) \, dt \ra = \la \int_a^b g(t) - f(t) \, dt \ra.
\end{equation}
For any definite integral we know that 
\[\la \int_a^b h(t) \, dt \ra \leq \int_a^b \la h(t) \ra \, dt.\]
So it follows from (\ref{eq:Ex1_p39_1}) and (\ref{eq:Ex1_p39_2}) that 
\begin{align*}
d(I(g), I(f)) &=  \la \int_a^b g(t) - f(t) \, dt \ra \\
	&\leq \int_a^b \la g(t) - f(t) \ra \, dt  \\
	&< \epsilon.
\end{align*}
Thus, the function $I$ is continuous at every point in $X$, and is therefore a continuous function.

\item For each of the following, answer true if the statement is always true. If the statement is only sometimes true or never true, answer false and provide a concrete example to illustrate that the statement is false. If a statement is true, explain why. 

	\ba
	\item Let $f : X \to Y$ be a function, where $(X, d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y)$ are metric spaces. If $d_X$ is the discrete metric and $d_Y$ is any metric, then $f$ is continuous.
	
	\item Let $f : X \to Y$ be a function, where $(X, d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y)$ are metric spaces. If $d_Y$ is the discrete metric and $d_X$ is any metric, then $f$ is continuous.

	\item Let $d_1$ and $d_2$ be two metrics on a set $X$. The identity function $i_X : (X,d_1) \to (X,d_2)$ defined by $i_X(x) = x$ for every $x \in X$ is continuous. 
	
	\item Let $f$ and $g$ be continuous functions from $(\R^2, d_T)$ (the taxicab metric) to $(\R,d_E)$. Then the function $f+g$ from $(\R^2, d_T)$ to $(\R,d_E)$ defined by $(f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)$ for every $x \in \R^2$ is a continuous function.  
	
	\item If $(X, d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$ are metric spaces with $y \in Y$, then the constant function $f: X \to Y$ defined by $f(x) = y$ for every $x \in X$ is a continuous function.

	\item This statement is true. Let $a \in X$ and let $\epsilon$ be greater than 0. Let $\delta = 1$. Then if $x \in X$ with $d_X(x,a) < \delta$, then $x = a$. So $d_Y(f(x), f(a)) = 0 < \epsilon$. Since $f$ is continuous at every point, $f$ is a continuous function. 
	
	\item This statement is false. Let $f : (\R,d_E) \to (\R,d)$, where $d$ is the discrete metric, be defined by $f(x) = x$. Let $\epsilon = 0.5$ and $\delta$ be a positive real number. Let $x \in \R$ with $0 < |x| < \min\{1, \delta\}$. Then $d_E(x,0) < \delta$ but \[d(f(x),f(0)) = d(x,0) = 1 > \epsilon.\]
So $f$ is not continuous at $0$. 	
			
	\item This statement is false. Let $X = \R$, let $d_1 = d_E$, and $d_2$ be the discrete metric. Suppose $\epsilon < 1$. If $x \neq 0$ is in $\R$ with $d_E(x,0) < \delta$, where $\delta > 0$, then $d_2(i_X(x),i_X(0)) = d_2(x,0) = 1$ which is not less than $\epsilon$. So $i_X$ is not continuous at $0$ and $i_X$ is not a continuous function. 

	\item This statement is true. Let $\epsilon$ be greater than $0$ and let $a = (a_1,a_2) \in \R^2$. Since $f$ is continuous at $a$, there exists $\delta_f > 0$ such that $d_E(f(x),f(a)) < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$ whenever $d_T(x,a) < \delta_f$. Similarly, since $g$ is continuous at $a$, there exists $\delta_g > 0$ such that $d_E(g(x),g(a)) < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$ whenever $d_T(x, a) < \delta_g$. Let $\delta = \min\left\{\delta_f, \delta_g\right\}$. Now suppose that $d_T(x,a) < \delta$. Then 
\begin{align*}
d_E((f+g)(x), (f+g)(a)) &= d_E(f(x)+g(x), f(a) + g(a)) \\
	&= |f(x)-f(a) + g(x)-g(a)| 
	&\leq |f(x)-f(a)| + |g(x)-g(a)| \\
	&= d_E(f(x),f(a)) + d_E(g(x), g(a)) \\
	< \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} \\
	&= \epsilon.
\end{align*}
Thus, $f+g$ is a continuous function.

	\item This statement is true. Let $a \in X$. Let $\epsilon$ be positive and let $\delta = \epsilon$. If $d_X(x,a) < \delta$, then 
	\[d_Y(f(x),f(a)) = d_Y(y,y) = 0 < \epsilon.\]
